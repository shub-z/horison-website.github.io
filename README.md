# Code Refactor Starter Code
This website follows all of the acceptance criteria listed on the challege. 

This website needed a handful of fixed in both of the .html and .css
for both readablity and usabilty purposes.

All changes are listed as comments to make it as easy as possible to see what changes I made exactly

This project was used to test how good we are at debugging or catching some bad code. Basically a good intro to what we can expect for future jobs

no ones code will be perfect so this is a good example of what we can expect to do. Even to our own code to ensure it runs properly
